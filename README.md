# Project 3 @cmda-minor-web Â· 2018-2019
For this project I'm going to build a markdown texteditor. That allows users to learn the basics of markdown. With buttons that generate markdown code, the user will learn the different commands.

## How it will work
- When pressing enter a new p element must be created
  - Create empty line `when` there's no text
- You can edit by sel ecting and then clicking a butt

**First list**
- Line 1
- Line 2
  - Line 2.1
  - ## oaiwefj

**Second List**
- Line 3
  - Line 3.1
    - Line 3.1.1
    - Line 3.1.2
  - Line 3.2

```js

const foo = "1";

function bar(p) {
  return p + p;
}

bar(foo)
```
